A simple repository to fool around with three.js while practicing skills with WebGL

I'm looking forward to creating my own react library by authoring components based on three.js. The intent would be to create a small toolbelt of modular components for an elevated front end experience.

In the future, I would love to explore integrating binaural audio and three.js stereoscopic rendering for a fully immersive AR component. 

To run:
Create a `.env` file in the root branch to set environment variables like hosting port.
Install dependencies via `npm i`
then
`npm run build` followed by `npm run start`
  
Kindly ignore the fire hydrant that I whipped up for this test.
